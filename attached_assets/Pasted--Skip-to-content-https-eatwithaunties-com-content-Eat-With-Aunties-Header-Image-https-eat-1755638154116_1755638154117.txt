[Here is an article published in the Manchester Eve![Here is an article published in the Manchester Evening News about Auntie on the  21st January 2013.  We couldn't fit the whole article on this post so we have included a link at the bottom of the page.  "AT 70, when most men and women are long retired, supergran Gurmit Pannum is busy doing what she loves most - cooking at her top restaurant in Manchester. She, along with her family, own Shimla Pinks, favourite curry house of the famous. Posh and Becks love Pinks' spicy fare, Justin Timberlake (already minus Britney!) has quaffed larger with his vindaloo while Robbie Williams orders a takeaway when he's in town. But celebrity status does not phase granny Gurmit - after nearly 40-years in business with husband Gurmain, she knows hard work and consistency are the key of success.  Gurmit's working day would floor a healthy 21-year-old. It starts at their family home in Coventry over 100 miles from work. She rises at 9am cleans and puts the home in order before cooking for her husband, five years her senior and retired. She then jumps into her car and drives herself to the restaurant. After this two hour journey through heavy traffic, many would be ready for a a snooze, but for super-gran the serious part of the day has just begun. She is in charge of all the restaurant's vegetarian dishes and with increasing emphasis on healthy eating this is an ever expanding menu. Said Gurmit: "I love cooking which is why I entered the business in the first place. I couldn't sit at home and do nothing, I like to keep busy which is why, touch wood, I am still very healthy." Gurmit works through the afternoon into the night when the restaurant is packed and activity in the kitchen reaches a crescendo...."
